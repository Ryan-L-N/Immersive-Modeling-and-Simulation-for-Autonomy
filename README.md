# Immersive Modeling and Simulation for Autonomy

## Problem

Quadrupedal robots face significant challenges in cluttered terrain, frequently falling, getting stuck, or failing to navigate the space entirely. While this might appear straightforward to solve, it remains a genuinely difficult problem even with advanced sensing and computation.

## Motivation

Our motivation for this is to enhance quadruped locomotion in unstructured environments (like those typically found on a battlefield).

## Goal

Our specific goal of this repository is to use one of Isaac Sim's built-in quadruped Spot models, develop a custom reinforcement learning policy for locomotion that outperforms Isaac Sim's default Flat Terrain and Rough Terrain policies in cluttered environments.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone this repo. <git clone https://github.com/Ryan-L-N/Capstone.git>
2. Create a virtual environment named "isaacSim_env".  It must match this exactly so the virtual environment is not tracked by git.  "isaacSim_env" is already in the .gitignore file.
3. Activate the virtual environment
4. Install the requirements <pip install -r requirements.txt>
